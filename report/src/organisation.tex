\section{Agile methodology}

In the team I was working, we were organized around Agile software
development. This way of working promotes incremental results and adaptive planning.
There are several implementations of Agile methods. In our team we were using Scrum.

In order to understand how I worked during my internship, some key concepts of Scrum must be described.

\subsection{The team}
Our team is composed of six members, all software engineers with various
skills. Some are more software design oriented while others more hardware
specialists.

In a Scrum, some members have a particular role:
\begin{description}
    \item[The Product owner]
        defines what the team is doing during a Sprint (see \ref{sec:sprint}).
        He determines the priority of each story (see \ref{sec:story} the team is working on. His input usually comes from
        clients. He is the business-oriented person in the team. His decisions have an impact on the results a Scrum team delivers.
    \item[The Scrum master]
        ensures that every team member is correctly focused on his story. He is keeping track of the progress of each member and
        should alert the Product owner when some planning issues occur (bad time estimation, very urgent incoming task, ...).
\end{description}

Note that in our team, the Product owner and the Scrum master were also contributing to the team as a software engineer.

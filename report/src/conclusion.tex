\subsection{Evolution}

\section{Personal outcome}

\subsection{Consistency with university classes}
% Things i missed within CAMSI
Lack of C++
No real courses about "good software practices"
No real guidelines about some tools we really should know (\gls{git}, a good editor like \gls{vim})
No real lesson about "scripting languages", such as python.
% Things i loved from CAMSI
A lot of projects, stimulating. Independence. Broad-minded courses.
Lot of code.


\subsection{Career consequences}
During the middle of my internship, I was actively searching for a job. CELAD offered my a position to work
as contractor at Intel, in the same team I worked with for six months.
Since I learned a \emph{lot} during my internship, I can't wait to continue learning follow my career
as an agile software developer!

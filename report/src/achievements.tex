\section{FixedPointParameter enhancements}
The parameter-framework has several kinds of parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item IntegerParameter
    \item BooleanParameter
    \item FixedPointParameter
    \item TODO OTHERS
\end{itemize}

Fixed point numbers are useful for representing fractional numbers. It is used
when the processor does not haves a floating point unit or when there is a
performance gain by using them.(TODO reword)

The implementation of Fixed point numbers had some corner cases which were not
correctly handled. Round issues appear when we were writing to a configuration
file or displaying user input. In order to support those corner cases, the
implementation had to be changed, and tested.

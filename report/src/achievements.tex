    to the Parameter-framework, which was presented in section

\section{Context}

\subsection{Android architecture}

\subsection{Audio XML HAL}
Scalable, fully configurable, userland

\subsection{Parameter framework}
Middleware, gap, no standard

\section{Defining the new middleware standard}
\subsection{Discovery tutorials}

At the start of my internship, I had to check out the Parameter-framework's
source code without any documentation. The idea was to have a fresh look at
this piece of software to determine if it was open-source ready, straightforward
to use, for someone who is unfamiliar with it.

While doing that, I struggled a bit with the basic usage of the framework. The
team decided that it would be nice to have some newcomer tutorials and examples,
for an easier early-adoption of the open-source community. So I wrote several
tutorials:
\begin{description}
    \item[Compile and install]
    \item[Run a simple example]
    \item[An introduction to the .pfw language]\label{desc:pfw-language}
\end{description}

\subsection{Open-sourcing on GitHub}
Pull requests to simulate external contributions.

\section{Improving build process}
\subsection{Build process}
pwf language as described here\ref{desc:pfw-language} is used for rule based
description. Need structure files as well, which are written in XML.

Some constraints may apply. Writting XML is error prone, and no check was done at
build time. Lead to run-time errors and undefined behaviour.

\section{FixedPointParameter enhancements}
The parameter-framework has several kinds of parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item IntegerParameter
    \item BooleanParameter
    \item FixedPointParameter
    \item StringParameter
    \item EnumParameter
    \item And more..
\end{itemize}

Fixed point numbers are useful for representing fractional numbers. Their usage
is appropriate when the processor does not haves a floating point unit or when
there is a performance gain by using them.

The implementation of fixed point numbers in the Parameter-framework had some
corner cases which were not correctly handled. Round issues appeared when we
were writing to a configuration file or displaying user input. In order to
support the expected behaviour for thos cases, I changed the implementation, and
wrote tests for it.

\section{Parameter-framework's intellectual property}
BSD
Private
\subsection{license checker}
Python internal tool

\section{Alsa plugin refactoring}
Not the same controls, some proprietary code was mixed with open-source code.
Some part of the code is Intel specific. We do not wish to open-source that.

\subsection{Alsa}
\subsection{Tinyalsa}
\subsection{Plugin architecture}
CTL and MIX merged

\section{Debug and trace participation}

\section{File system plugin upload}

\section{Core upload}
Requirements, vanilla AOSP, internal tree and open-source version must be the
same.
